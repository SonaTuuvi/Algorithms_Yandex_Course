# Linked List and Data Structures Practice

## Overview

This repository contains C++ programs that demonstrate key concepts in data structures and algorithms. Each program solves a specific problem, focusing on practical implementations and efficiency.

---

## Topics Covered

### Sprint_2_Basic data structures
### Final_Tasks_2


#### A. Deque Implementation Using a Circular Buffer
- Implements a deque with constant-time operations (`push_front`, `push_back`, `pop_front`, `pop_back`).
- Utilizes a circular buffer to optimize space and time complexity.
- Handles edge cases like overflow and underflow.

---

####  B. Expression Evaluation in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
- Uses a stack-based approach to evaluate RPN expressions.
- Supports arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) with proper error handling.
- Demonstrates efficient parsing and token processing.

---
### Tasks_Sprint_2

####  A. Matrix Transposition
- Reads a matrix, transposes it (swaps rows and columns), and outputs the result.
- Uses 2D vectors for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation.
- Showcases efficient nested loops for matrix operations.

---

####  B. Printing a Singly Linked List
- Implements a `Node` structure for singly linked lists.
- Traverses and prints all elements from the head node to the end.
- Demonstrates pointer management and list traversal techniques.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Dynamic data structures: Deque, Stack, Linked List.
- Matrix operations: Transposition and manipulation.
- Stack-based evaluation for mathematical expressions.
- Efficient handling of edge cases in algorithms.
